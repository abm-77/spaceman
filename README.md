# S P A C E M A N

Simple top-down shooter game made in one weekend using the SDL2 framework. All artwork is generated using primitives. This is my first time implenting a memory arena and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out.

To build this project, ensure that you have the SDL2, SDL_image, and SDL_ttf frameworks installed. You can edit the compilation and linker settings of the bash script to fit your environment.
